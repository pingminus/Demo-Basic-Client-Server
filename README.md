## Overview

This project consists of two main components: a server and a client. The server listens for incoming connections, while the client connects to the server, sends a message, and receives a response.

### How It Works

1. The server starts and waits for a client connection.
2. The client connects to the server and sends a message.
3. The server receives the message, processes it, and sends a response back to the client.
4. The client displays the response from the server.
